### DEPRECATED

This package (`standard-react`) is **DEPRECATED**. Supporting `standard` already takes
a ton of time. Supporting a fork isn't worth the effort, especially since this gets
less than 200 downloads per month, half of which are probably bots. There are only
a handful of extra rules this package provides anyway...

`v3.0.0` will be the last version of this package. It corresponds to the `v8.0.0`
release of standard.

If someone wants to become the new maintainer, send me an email.

### For React users

`standard` v6 removed React-specific linting rules (see: [standard/#351](https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/351), [standard/#367](https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/367), and [eslint-config-standard-react/#13](https://github.com/feross/eslint-config-standard-react/pull/13)) to make `standard` usable for folks who use React alternatives like `virtual-dom` or `deku`.

JSX is still supported in `standard` and React users are still encouraged to the main `standard` package. But if you want the old behavior back, with React-specific rules, you can use `standard-react`.

The extra rules come from [eslint-config-standard-react](https://github.com/feross/eslint-config-standard-react).
